TITLE: Image Segmentation using Gaussian Mixture Modeling (GMM) with Expectation Maximization (EM). 

DESCRIPTION: This folder contains an implementation of a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) trained using the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm. It is used to detect skin in photographs and to segment the image into skin and non-skin pixels. 

INSTRUCTIONS: Run the file apply.py, which contains the main thread of implementation.
