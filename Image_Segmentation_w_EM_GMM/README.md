DESCRIPTION: This project applies soft clustering with a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) trained using expectation maximization (EM) for the purpose of image segmentation. Specifically, the GMM is used to differentiate between skin and non-skin pixels in images of people. 

INSTRUCTIONS: Run the file main.py. Three simulated data sets generated using 3, 4, 5 and clusters are used to test the implementation. The code for simulating the data is commented out at the beginning of the "if __name__ == '__main__':" section of the script; the number of data points and parameters of the GMM used to generate them may be adjusted here. Data is then read in from the resulting files - Data1.txt, Data2.txt, Data3.txt - and a Gaussian mixture model fit to each. A plot of each dataset is generated; to proceed with the script after the first plot is generated, simply click the red x at the upper left of the plot window. For each dataset, the optimal number of clusters for the GMM is determined by plotting the log likelihood with the number of clusters - the number of clusters is then chosen as the "elbow" point at which the log likelihood function plateaus. In each case, the number of clusters identified in this manner agrees with the number of clusters of the GMM used to generate the corresponding dataset. Finally, a GMM model is trained on skin vs non-skin pixels and then used on a given photograph to identify skin pixels in the photo.
