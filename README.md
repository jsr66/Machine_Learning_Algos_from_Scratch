# Machine_Learning_Algos_from_Scratch

My implementations "from scratch" - i.e., in numpy - of various machine learning algorithms. This code still needs cleaning and commenting, but works - it has been tested by Columbia's graduate-level machine learning course grader, or the course graders in RWTH Aachen University's Visual Computing Institute.
