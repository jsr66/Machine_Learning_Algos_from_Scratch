This project builds a movie recommendation system "from scratch" using probabilistic matrix factorization (PMF), trained on user data from the MovieLens dataset. 

Given an $NxM$ matrix M with most entries missing, where the entry $M_ij$ is an observed value if $(i,j) \in \Omega$, and empty otherwise, PMF seeks to find $N$ vectors
